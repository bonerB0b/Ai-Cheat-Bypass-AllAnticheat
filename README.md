# Ai-Cheat-Bypass-AllAnticheat
At the age of 16 for fun i made a AI Image detection cheat
i started simply getting back into python since iv had experience at 15 building random software and used chatgpt for 8hrs to get a awful ineficient cheat wich worked so slow and was so weak.let alone my pc is really strong and runs 240fps on many shooter games.
i next deleted the whole script and started from scratch nad watched simple vids on yolo and then went to doccumentation and continued from there
in a day i had a fully working lock on script with no smoothness with 400 images 
then i continued to improve it for 2 weeks i spent a lot of time since i didnt even use python libraries lol cuz of how slow it was and i needed lots of mathematical calculations(secondary school simple stuff just lots of calculations to be made)
then i had to research fastest libraries for each function i needed like get screen or file stuff to use nvidia like .engine .onnx i didnt really understand it well it was more problem solving skills i used idk how i understood it well but same time i didnt but who cares cuz i made it work
then i used it for roblox wich has such strong lock on cuz its cpu based compared to cs2 i used 100fps of gameplay to be able to run the cheat barely it was strong but not too strong as roblox or other games
i tried to get it to work on fortnite but i had my screen resolution bugging so if player was in centre it would aim to the right i just ended up not bothering cuz i dont play that game but i used it on my main account same with roblox and cs2
i still play on that cs2 account to this day without cheats but on cs2 it was still very strong dropping 8kd in some games in dust with ssg
honestly the ssg with the cheat was way too OP

above is a link to the cheat demonstration in its final steps with some gui i made to change script
and yes i can make it not lock on 24/7 its a simple couple line script to make it toggle but i prefered it like this
NO PROMO
All im trying to do is look for a company i can work for experience part time(1-2 tasks a day)
im 17 in September
